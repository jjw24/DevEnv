# Bash Scripting Conventions
- **Safeguards:** All scripts must start with the shebang `#!/usr/bin/env bash` followed by `set -euo pipefail`. This ensures the script exits on error and handles unset variables and piped commands correctly.
- **Quoting:** Always use double quotes for all variable expansions (`"$my_var"`) and command substitutions to prevent word splitting and glob expansion.
- **Portability:** Use portable POSIX-compliant syntax whenever possible. Avoid Bash-specific features unless necessary.
- **Functions:** Use functions to organize code. Define them with the `function` keyword and local variables with the `local` keyword.
- **Readability:** Use clear variable names and add comments to explain complex sections of the script.
