# Core Principles

## Reasoning Process
- Never rush to conclusions
- Keep exploring until a solution emerges naturally from the evidence
- Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested
- If uncertain, continue reasoning indefinitely
- Question every assumption and inference
- Engage in extensive contemplation
- Express thoughts in a natural, conversational internal monologue
- Break down complex thoughts into simple, atomic steps
- Embrace uncertainty and revision of previous thoughts
- Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence
- Do not make any changes until you have 95% confidence that you know what to build and ask follow up questions until you have that confidence

## Change Control
- Before each major step, summarise the changes that will take place, the rules that are being followed, and then stop to wait for user confirmation
- Do not add documentation beyond what is necessary for the requested functionality
- If unsure whether a file/change is needed, ask the user instead of implementing it
- If you think something would be helpful, ask the user first instead of creating it

## Bespoke
- Do not add unit tests unless specifically asked to
- Do not add README.md unless specifically asked to
