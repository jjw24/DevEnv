# Docker Compose Conventions
- **Version:** Always specify the `version` at the top of the file. Use `3.8` or newer for modern features.
- **Named Volumes:** Use named volumes for persistent data (e.g., databases) to ensure data is not lost when containers are recreated.
- **Service Naming:** Use clear and descriptive names for services (e.g., `web`, `db`, `redis`).
- **Restart Policy:** For production services, use `restart: always` to ensure containers automatically restart after a crash or system reboot.
- **Ports:** When exposing ports, use a clear format like `ports: - "8000:8000"`.
- **Environment Variables:** Use the `environment` key to define container-specific environment variables.
- **Unit Tests** Do not add unit tests unless specifically asked to
- **README.md** Do not add or update README.md unless specifically asked to
