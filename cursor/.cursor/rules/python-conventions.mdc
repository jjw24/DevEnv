# Python Conventions
- **Style:** Adhere strictly to PEP 8 for code style. Use `black` formatting and avoid trailing whitespace.
- **Type Hinting:** Use type hints for function signatures and variables to improve readability and static analysis.
- **Readability:** Prioritize clear, descriptive variable and function names.
- **Docstrings:** Use Google-style docstrings for all functions, classes, and methods.
- **Error Handling:** Use specific `try...except` blocks to handle expected exceptions. Avoid broad `except:` clauses.
- **Dependency Management:** Ensure all dependencies are managed within a virtual environment.
