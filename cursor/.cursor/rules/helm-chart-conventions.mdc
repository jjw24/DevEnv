# Helm Chart Conventions

## Change Control
- Always refer to Helm Chart documentation at https://helm.sh/docs/ when making changes

## Bespoke
- Never add deployment automation (deploy.sh, install.sh, etc.) unless explicitly requested
- Never add testing frameworks or test scripts unless explicitly requested
- Stick to standard Helm chart structure: Chart.yaml, values.yaml, templates/, and documentation
- Add what is specifically requested - no "helpful extras"
